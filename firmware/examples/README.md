# Device Template Examples

This directory contains pre-configured device templates for common IoT monitoring scenarios. These templates are integrated into the **Web-Based Firmware Builder** and can be used without manual configuration.

## Web-Based Firmware Builder (Recommended)

**The easiest way to use these templates is through the web interface:**

1. **Visit the Firmware Builder**: `https://your-platform.com/firmware-builder`
2. **Select a template** from the visual gallery
3. **Configure device settings** (WiFi, sensors, etc.)
4. **Flash directly via browser** using WebSerial API OR download firmware package
5. **Device auto-registers** and starts sending data immediately

## Manual Configuration (Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual setup:
1. Copy the content from one of the example files
2. Paste it into `firmware/device_config.h`
3. Update the WiFi credentials and server URL with your actual values
4. Flash the firmware to your ESP8266

## Configuration Guidelines

### WiFi Settings
Always update these fields with your actual network credentials:
```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "YOUR_ACTUAL_WIFI_NAME"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your_actual_wifi_password"
```

### Server Settings
Update with your IoT platform URL:
```cpp
#define SERVER_URL "https://your-iot-platform.com"
#define SERVER_API_KEY "your_api_key_if_needed"
```

### Device Identity
Each device should have a unique ID:
```cpp
#define DEVICE_ID "KITCHEN_001"  // Change for each device
#define DEVICE_NAME "Kitchen Monitor"
#define DEVICE_LOCATION "Kitchen"
```

## Pin Conflicts

**Important**: The ESP8266 has limited analog pins. Only one sensor can use A0 at a time:
- Light Sensor (A0)
- Sound Sensor (A0)
- Gas Sensor (A0)

Choose only ONE of these sensors per device, or use external multiplexing.

## Sensor Wiring Reference

### DHT22 (Temperature/Humidity)

## Power Considerations

- **5V Sensors**: Some sensors (HC-SR04) work best with 5V supply
- **3.3V Logic**: ESP8266 GPIO pins are 3.3V - use level shifters if needed
- **Power Consumption**: Consider deep sleep mode for battery-powered applications
- **Current Draw**: Each sensor adds to total current consumption

## Troubleshooting

1. **Compile Errors**: Make sure all required libraries are installed
2. **WiFi Connection Issues**: Check SSID/password, signal strength
3. **Sensor Readings**: Verify wiring and power supply
4. **Server Communication**: Confirm server URL and network connectivity
5. **Memory Issues**: Reduce `TELEMETRY_BATCH_SIZE` if experiencing crashes

## Adding Custom Configurations

To create a new configuration:

1. Copy an existing example file
2. Modify the device identification
3. Enable/disable sensors as needed
4. Adjust thresholds for your use case
5. Update pin assignments if needed
6. Test thoroughly before deployment
